# What is HTTPS Finder?

**HTTPS Finder** automatically detects and enforces valid HTTPS connections as you browse,
as well as automating the rule creation process for **HTTPS Everywhere** (instead of having
to manually type "https://" in the address bar to test, and writing your own XML rule for it).

The extension sends a small **HTTPS** request to each **HTTP** page you browse to.
If there is a response, the certificate is checked for validity (any certificate errors will 
result in no notification, and no further detection requests during that session).
If valid, **HTTPS** is automatically enforced (can be disabled for an alert only, with no redirect),
and the user is given an option to save the auto-generated rule for **HTTPS Everywhere**.
It is recommended to create rules whenever possible, as it more securely enforces secure connections.
