    There exist several targets which are by default empty and which can be 
    used for execution of your tasks. These targets are usually executed 
    before and after some main targets. They are: 

      -pre-chrome:             called before copy chrome files
      -post-chrome:             called after copy chrome files
      -pre-jar:             called before create chrome jar
      -post-jar:             called after create chrome jar
      -pre-dist:                  called before xpi building
      -post-dist:                 called after xpi building

    (Targets beginning with '-' are not intended to be called on their own.)

    Example of inserting an obfuscator after compilation could look like this:

        <target name="-post-chrome">
            <echo message="hello world"/>
        </target>

    For list of available properties check the imported 
    nbproject/build-moz-impl.xml file.
